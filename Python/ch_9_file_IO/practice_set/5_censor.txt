The monstrous ruins stood beneath a cursed sky,
whispering tales of greed that had once brought
kingdoms to their knees. A venomous tension 
lingered in the air, as if the stones themselves
remembered the savage battles fought upon them. 
Legends spoke of bloodthirsty rulers whose thirst 
for power spread a stench of death across the land,
leaving behind a legacy as corrupt as the shadows 
that still haunted the place.
